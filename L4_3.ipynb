    "Python [module](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#modules) refers to a piece of Python code that is designed to execute a spesific task. Technically, modules are simply Python script files (file extension`.py`) that contain function definitions and other statements. Python [packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) are a way of organizing modules into larger entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules and packages are similar to what are more generally called libraries in programming languages, which again contain code related to a specific task such as mathematical operations.\n",
    "There are a *HUGE* number of Python modules/packages, and many of them greatly extend what can be done in a normal Python program.\n",
